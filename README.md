# Eric O Barragan

### I am a Psychology student at the University of Texas at Austin who is also pursuing an Informatics minor & an Elements of Computing Certificate (Python). 

I am immersing myself in a  unique blended environment of the humanities and computational sciences in hopes of pursuing data analytics/science! So far I have learned Rstudio, Python, and HTML5 during my time here at UT and have applied my skills at my current internship as a Data Quality Intern at the Texas Department of Transportation. I hope to expand my skill set and immerse myself in the machine learning world! :)
